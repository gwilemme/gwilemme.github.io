I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Leicester, School of Business](https://le.ac.uk/school-of-business).

Research fields: Labour Economics, Structural Econometrics.

I investigate how job search prospects affect workers' careers â€“ examining for instance how they influence the choice of occupation or place to live, as well as the response of workers to public policies. In my research, I use both theoretical models and econometric analyses, sometimes combined together.
